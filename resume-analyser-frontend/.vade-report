# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Angular application following the official Vercel documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- **File**: `package.json`
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` as a dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` accordingly

### 2. Speed Insights Integration
- **File**: `src/app/app.ts`
- Added import: `import { injectSpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights';`
- Called `injectSpeedInsights()` in the App component constructor to initialize the tracking script

## Implementation Details

For Angular applications, the Speed Insights integration follows the "other" framework pattern from Vercel's documentation:
- The `injectSpeedInsights()` function is imported from `@vercel/speed-insights`
- It's called once in the root App component constructor to inject the tracking script
- The function runs in the client and automatically adds the necessary tracking scripts

## Testing

- ✅ Build completed successfully without errors
- ✅ Speed Insights code confirmed in the production bundle
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Application structure and existing functionality preserved

## Next Steps

To complete the Speed Insights setup:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. Once deployed, verify that `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` is accessible
4. View metrics in the Vercel dashboard under the "Speed Insights" tab

## Notes

- The integration is minimal and non-intrusive
- Speed Insights will only work when deployed to Vercel (requires Vercel infrastructure)
- No changes to existing application logic or behavior
- The tracking respects Vercel's privacy and compliance standards
